Our monthly General Body Meetings are agenda-driven gatherings while more informal events like field days, Thanksgiving potluck, and Yoga on the Lawn allow members to further engage with the organization.","The Sports committee organizes tournaments and practices for Volleyball, Soccer, and Football. Meanwhile, the Community committee drives charity initiatives like fundraising for Typhoon Rai relief and food drives."],l=["With an extensive network of alumni representing decades, OYFA offers far-reaching mentoring capacity. Our support for young alumni enables current members to be paired with a former Oyfan mentor from their career field of choice, and creates continuation in OYFA's membership far beyond graduation.","The annual Excellence Award, presented at Barrio, presents a talented first-year student with a $500 scholarship. The Excellence Scholarship is funded through our events and maintained by the Scholarship committee, who are tasked with further promoting academic excellence.","OYFA strives to produce leaders in the wider community. The Board and Council is the organization's formally elected governing and programming body; leadership development and opportunities are also available for general body members to oversee large events such as Barrio and through workshopping. Oyfans emerge more skilled, thoughtful, independent, and culturally-minded."],m=["OYFA represents UVa's contribution to District 7 of the Filipino Intercollegiate Networking Dialogue (FIND D-7), a larger network of collegiate Fil-Am organizations.
