/** Webmaster Directions: 
 * 1. Copy our current BNC and LEADERSHIP_FOLDER, paste it underneath into the Archive section
 *    and rename to BNC{B&C Number}. 
 * 2. Add this new archived B&C to the list of other archived B&Cs at the bottom called
 *    BNC_ARCHIVE (Minimize old B&Cs to make looking through this file easier). 
 * 3. With the original BNC, update the LEADERSHIP_FOLDER to be the current year's
 *    folder where all the images will be stored and update the JSON information!
 * 4. In your LEADERSHIP_FOLDER, add an image named Leadership_Title.jpg (must be exactly
 *    this including file format and capitalization of jpg) to change the photo of the 
 *    HalfTitle.
 * NOTE: Remember that if you don't follow the same photo naming convention we used (ex. 
 *    Leadership_{Position}.jpg) you will have to manually change the ImgSrc values in
 *    the JSON as well!
 * 
 * FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS: If we are ever able to use a NoSQL database, that could replace
 * this perfectly. With how different bio information has been throughout the years,
 * using our MySQL database or any structured database would be a nightmare and make
 * future changes/additions very difficult.

I am a talker and can talk your ear off, so if you're down to hang I'm here! I am also a huge foodie, so come get food with me too. Maybe I'll cook, you never know.\n Anyways, I somehow found my way into OYFA my first year and was able to find people who I call my best friends and practically my family. I remember being hesitant in joining, until Sofia dragged me out to make Tiktoks with her and then the rest was history!",

Outside of OYFA and being a nursing student, I am apart of MAN and was an OL this summer, so hi if you were an orientee of mine! When I'm not doing anything related to school or OYFA, I love to bake, cook, eat sugar lol, run, read manga, and binge anime.\nBesides the above, I also love to see people smile. Seeing people happy with who they are and what they do is as addicting as sugar to me, and I always strive to create that environment it whatever situation I am in.\nAs for OYFA, it may sound clich√©, but OYFA has given me a home in the grand place that is UVA, and I am eternally grateful for that. Coming in as a first year during a pandemic was tough, but somehow, OYFA helped me grow in ways I never imagined, try new things I never would have given thought to (like dancing LOL), and let me meet and form friendships with people I will treasure or the rest of my life.\nSo enough of me already, we can talk about that another time. If you're reading this and you're on the website... see you at OYFA events and I hope to get to know you and see you smile :))"

Because of OYFA, I was supported by so many people during one of the most difficult and shifting periods of my life. I believed that OYFA was invaluable and unexplainably amazing, so I struggled to see myself as the facilitator for more. Although I love OYFA to death, I saw so many parts of the organization that made my life more stressful and challenging. The first time I ran for President, I set out to make a change to make the organization the best place to be the best version of themselves. The reason I ran a second time, I realized that I still want to make that change. We can constantly revise the organization to reflect what the community needs. However, before I leave UVA, I want to call out the issues affecting the whole University and hold administration accountable so that OYFA and the AAPI community can thrive. OYFA deserves to be a space where students at UVA can celebrate what it means to be Filipino-American, and I intend to make that last for generations."

These conversations are ones that I think a lot about more as I'm involved with Asian American representation, sexual assault prevention, and mental health awareness, but I still don't allow myself to feel or process through my insecurities about myself. By the end of next year, I need to find a therapist I trust and do what I need to do in order to become more comfortable with who I am as an individual.

In the class we learned about what Asians have gone through in the past 200 years and how they are represented in today's society. Understanding that the racialization of people have hugely affected their livelihood is something that isn't really discussed in typical 'favorite' classes, especially about Asian Americans. So many diversity discussions are seen in black and white, so I will forever preach people to take the class!"

 *  bncNum - Which number B&C it is
 *  bnc - Actual JSON Array of the Committees
 *  imgPath - Image used in the LeadershipArchive component (I chose to use the Title Banner image for all of them,
 *      it can be something different if you'd like).
 *  position - Vertical position of the Title Banner image in the HalfTitle component
 *  format - specific format with additional props defined in Leadership. Read more in that component but it changes
 *      things like how many members are being displayed on board, if council is missing for a given B&C, etc.
